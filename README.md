## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **AdaptiveX**
A passwordless QR-based authentication mechanism that allows users to securely log in by scanning a QR code via the IOB mobile app — improving user experience and reducing password fatigue.

### 2. **NeuroBehaviour**
An AI engine that monitors user behavior such as:
- Keystroke dynamics
- Mouse/cursor movement patterns
- Session duration and interaction flow

This behavioral data is analyzed using deep learning to detect anomalies, helping to prevent unauthorized access in real-time.

### 3. **FlowAuth**
A training module that collects behavioral data from verified sessions. This data trains the NeuroBehaviour model to increase accuracy and user-specific behavior recognition.

### 4. **SmartOTP**
A dynamic OTP system integrated into the IOB mobile app. OTPs regenerate every 30 seconds and are device-local, removing the need for SMS and thus reducing the risk of SIM-swapping and interception attacks.

### 5. **PhishShield**
An intelligent phishing detection component that identifies and blocks access to malicious and spoofed banking websites. It uses a combination of domain analysis, content matching, and AI-driven phishing signatures.
